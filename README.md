## About The Project
**End-to-End Encrypted Messaging App**

This app is a client app for end-to-end encrypted messaging. Messages are encrypted using a key shared between the sender and receiver. The key can be generated by users during a login process or shared in advance.

The app can receive text messages.

The app uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that all messages are transmitted encrypted. This means that only the sender and receiver can read the messages. Third parties cannot read or decrypt the messages.

The app is open source and can be inspected by anyone. This ensures that the app is reliable and secure.
